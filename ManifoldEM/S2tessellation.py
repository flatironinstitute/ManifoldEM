def collect_nearest_neighbors(X, Q):
    """
    Finds the nearest neighbors of a set of query points Q within a dataset X and counts
    the occurrences of each point in X being the nearest neighbor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        An array of shape (n_samples, n_features) representing the dataset
        within which to search for nearest neighbors. Each row corresponds to a data point.
    Q : np.ndarray
        An array of shape (n_queries, n_features) representing the query points for which
        the nearest neighbors in X are to be found. Each row corresponds to a query point.

    Returns
    tuple
        np.ndarray
            An array of indices of the nearest neighbors in X for each query point in Q.
            Shape is (n_queries, 1).
        np.ndarray
            An array of counts indicating how many times each point in X is the nearest
            neighbor to the points in Q. Shape is (n_samples,).

    Notes
    -----
    - The function uses the 'ball_tree' algorithm for efficient nearest neighbor search,
      which is particularly suitable for datasets with a large number of samples and/or
      high dimensionality.
    - This could be trivially done with an all-pairs search in numba, but is not really a bottleneck
    - The `NearestNeighbors` class from scikit-learn is used to fit the model on dataset X
      and then query the nearest neighbors for points in Q.
    - The `bin_counts` array provides a histogram-like count of nearest neighbor occurrences,
      which can be useful for understanding the density or distribution of query points around
      the dataset X.

def lovisolo_silva_tessellation(N: int) -> NDArray[Shape["*,3"], Float64]:
    """
    Distributes `N` points roughly uniformly on a unit 3-sphere using the Lovisolo-Silva algorithm.

    Parameters
    ---------
    N : int
        The number of points to attempt to distribute on the 3-sphere.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray[float]
        An ndarray of shape (~N, 3) containing the coordinates of the points distributed on the 3-sphere.
        The algorithm may return slightly more or fewer points than requested due to the discretization process.

    Notes
    -----
    - The algorithm aims for a uniform distribution by adjusting the spacing between points
      based on the surface area of a unit 3-sphere and the desired number of points.
    - It iteratively adjusts the spacing (delta) to approach the target number of points,
      recalculating the distribution in each iteration until the desired number is reached
      or the maximum number of iterations (maxIter) is exceeded.
    - This method is useful for generating points for applications requiring uniform
      coverage of a spherical surface, such as sampling, simulations, or geometric analyses.

        bins based on the surface area of the unit sphere.
    thres_low : int
        The lower threshold for the number of points in a bin to be considered significant.
        Bins with less than this parameter are discarded.
    tesselator : str

        'fibonacci'.
    plane_vec : ndarray, default=np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0])

        ndarray
            An ndarray of ndarrays, where each subarray contains indices of points in S2 that fall

        ndarray
            The coordinates of the centers of the bins on S2.
